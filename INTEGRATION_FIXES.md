# ASR-GoT MCP Server - Integration Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Startup Performance Issues**
**Problem**: The MCP server was taking 60+ seconds to initialize, causing timeout errors in Claude Desktop.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented lazy loading of ASR-GoT modules
- Removed heavy imports from startup
- Optimized logging configuration for faster startup
- Server now starts in under 1 second

### 2. **MCP Protocol Compliance**
**Problem**: The server wasn't properly implementing the MCP 2024-11-05 protocol specification.

**Solution**:
- Added proper `notifications/initialized` handler
- Fixed capabilities response format
- Improved error handling and response formatting
- Added proper protocol version negotiation

### 3. **Configuration Issues**
**Problem**: The Claude Desktop configuration was using an incorrect format.

**Solution**:
- Fixed `claude_desktop_config.json` to use proper MCP server format
- Updated setup script to generate correct configuration
- Added proper environment variables and paths

### 4. **Import and Dependency Issues**
**Problem**: Heavy dependencies were being imported at startup causing delays.

**Solution**:
- Implemented lazy import pattern for ASR-GoT modules
- Only import heavy dependencies when actually needed
- Reduced startup dependencies to minimum required

## Key Changes Made

### `mcp-wrapper/mcp_server.py`
- Added lazy import function `_import_asr_got()`
- Optimized logging configuration
- Added `notifications/initialized` handler
- Fixed initialization response format
- Improved error handling

### `setup_claude_desktop.py`
- Updated configuration generation
- Added LOG_LEVEL environment variable
- Fixed paths and virtual environment handling

### `config/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Completely rewrote to use proper MCP server format
- Removed incorrect HTTP-based configuration
- Added proper stdio-based MCP configuration

## Testing Results

### Before Fixes:
```
2025-05-27T04:28:29.326Z [asr-got] [info] Initializing server...
2025-05-27T04:29:29.783Z [asr-got] [info] Message from client: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/cancelled","params":{"requestId":0,"reason":"Error: MCP error -32001: Request timed out"}}
```

### After Fixes:
```
Starting MCP server...
2025-05-26 23:57:24,885 - asr-got-mcp-server - INFO - ASR-GoT MCP Server started
ASR-GoT MCP Server ready
2025-05-26 23:57:25,835 - asr-got-mcp-server - INFO - Received message: initialize
2025-05-26 23:57:25,836 - asr-got-mcp-server - INFO - Returning initialize response
```

**Startup time reduced from 60+ seconds to under 1 second!**

## How to Use

### 1. **Setup** (Already completed)
```bash
python setup_claude_desktop.py
```

### 2. **Restart Claude Desktop**
Close and reopen Claude Desktop to load the new MCP server configuration.

### 3. **Test the Integration**
In Claude Desktop, try asking:
```
Use the ASR-GoT tool to analyze this complex problem: What are the key factors in developing effective vaccines?
```

### 4. **Available Tools**
- `asr_got_query`: Process complex queries using Graph-of-Thoughts reasoning
- `get_graph_state`: Retrieve the current state of a reasoning graph

## Troubleshooting

### If the server still doesn't connect:
1. Check the logs in `mcp-wrapper/logs/mcp_server.log`
2. Verify the configuration in `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
3. Test the server manually: `python mcp-wrapper/mcp_server.py`

### If you see import errors:
1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated
2. Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Verify the PYTHONPATH is set correctly in the configuration

## Next Steps

The ASR-GoT MCP Server is now properly integrated with Claude Desktop and should work without timeout issues. The server will:

1. Start quickly (under 1 second)
2. Respond to initialization requests immediately
3. Load ASR-GoT modules only when needed for actual queries
4. Provide proper error handling and logging

You can now use the advanced reasoning capabilities of ASR-GoT directly within Claude Desktop conversations.
